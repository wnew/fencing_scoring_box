## Directory Structure

**allweaponbox** : Firmware for a scoring box which supports all three weapons.

If you wish to create a box with support for only one weapon, use the allweaponbox and set the initial weapon to your choice and dont include a weapon select button.

**test_box** :  Firmware for a test box, which will plug into a scoring box and test timings and touches. (Unreleased)

## Notes:
Epee and Foil have been tested and are working well. Although short circuit lights are not yet implemented.

Sabre has been implemented but not tested yet. I dont expect any issues as it is very similar to foil just without off target. Although whipover is not yet supported.
