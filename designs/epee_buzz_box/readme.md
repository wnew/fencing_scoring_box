# Epee Buzz Box Design

This is the design for an arduino based epee buzz box, it is a stand-alone batter powered device that is carried on a fencer and will signal a hit (with the correct timing) by sounding a buzzer.

The code can be found in the firmware folder, it is designed for the Arduino Uno or Nano, but should be able to work on any other Arduino variatio. The circuit can be found in the hardware folder.

The physical build is left up to you to design, including choice of hardware components, wiring, battery and housing.
